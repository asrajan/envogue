In HTML5, if a tag is allowed to have content then it is illegal to represent it using a self closing tag as seen in XML.

All, HTML tags must have atleast an opening tag. Some HTML tags like <br> and <hr> dont have any closing tag. 

The <head> tag contains meta data about the main content of the page. For example character encoding to be used while interpreting the page. 
The <head> tag must contain <title> tag else the HTML is invalid.
